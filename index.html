	<p>This website has a much more complicated layout than mine, with side blocks of additional information and links. There is also much greater variety of fonts and colors on the page. Some of the code I recognize. There are many lists and links, and lists of links. I also founds the header tags and most of the elements were in dive tags. There are a ton of script tags (which I'm guessing has to do with javascript) and class tags (which I think is part of the formatting with CSS).</p>
